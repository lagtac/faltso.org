## Issues

- See about working with gems on Fedora: https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/ruby/gems-installation.html 
- Extensions not building correctly. 
	Jekyll v. 4 depends on sassc 2.2.0, which does not build correctly. see https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby/issues/146. We downgraded to jekyll 3.8.6.
